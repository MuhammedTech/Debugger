## About
Bug Tracker is an application to track errors in software. It was created by Mukammed Alimbet as a student project for the UCLA Extension certificate program in "Application Programming". Bug Tracker uses a ticketing system to record bugs or other issues in the software development process on a per-project basis. It implements user- and role-level security to ensure only authorized users can access tickets and projects. The application was built using Python / Flask framework with an sqlite3 database.
