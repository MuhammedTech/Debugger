        <p>
Bug Tracker is an application to track errors in software. It was created by Mukammed Alimbet as a student project for the UCLA Extension certificate program in "Application Programming".

Bug Tracker uses a ticketing system to record bugs or other issues in the software development process on a per-project basis. It implements user- and role-level security to ensure only authorized users can access tickets and projects.

The application was built using Python / Flask framework with an sqlite3 database. Bug Trackerâ€™s webpages use HTML5/Bootstrap.

Roles: Bug Tracker has four roles that users can be assigned to. Users are automatically placed in a developer role upon registration.

Below are brief descriptions of the permissions of each role:
