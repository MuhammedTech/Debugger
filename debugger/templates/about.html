        <p>About Bug Tracker
Bug Tracker is an application to track errors in software. It was created by Annette Arrigucci as a student project for the Coder Foundry summer 2016 course.

Bug Tracker uses a ticketing system to record bugs or other issues in the software development process on a per-project basis. It implements user- and role-level security to ensure only authorized users can access tickets and projects.

The application was built using ASP.NET MVC and C# with an SQL Server database. Development was completed with Visual Studio Community 2015. Bug Trackerâ€™s webpages use HTML5, model binding with Razor and Bootstrap with the Bootswatch Spacelab theme applied.

Roles: Bug Tracker has four roles that users can be assigned to. A user can be in more than one role at one time. Users are automatically placed in a Submitter role upon registration.

Below are brief descriptions of the permissions of each role:
